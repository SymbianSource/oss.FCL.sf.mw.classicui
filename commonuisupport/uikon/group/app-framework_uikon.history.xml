    Fix for break in PDEF102396: Uikon needs cleanup for improved maintainability
    
    Reverted the following changes:
    
    * Removed two incorrect overrides of MEikCommandObserver reserved virtuals each from
    MEikMenuObserver and MEikAutoMenuObserver.
    * Removed two incorrect overrides of CEikMsgWin reserved virtuals each from CEikInfoMsgWin
    and CEikBusyMsgWin.
    * CEikServEnv incorrectly override 6 reserved virtual methods. These it clames are
    defined by CCoeEnv, CEikEnv, and MApaAppStarter, but in fact only the two defined
    by CCoeEnv has names matching those used by CEikServEnv. This means that four methods
    are actually new virtual definitions, and the two CCoeEnv virtuals should not be
    overrided. To fix this, the names of CEikServEnv&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s virtual overrides CEikonEnv_Reserved1(),
    CEikonEnv_Reserved2(), MApaAppStarter_Reserved1(), and MApaAppStarter_Reserved2(),
    were changed to CEikServEnv_Reserved3 through CEikServEnv_Reserved6, and the CCoeEnv
    overrides were removed. This preserves v-table layout.
    
    (CCoeEnv overrides were reinstated. The other four remains renamed.)
    
    Reverted the unintentional reclassification if the following methods (see BR2113):
    EXPORT_C void CEikonEnv::DestroyEnvironment()
    EXPORT_C void CEikonEnv::InitSystemFontsL()
    EXPORT_C void CEikonEnv::DestroyScreen()
    EXPORT_C void CEikonEnv::UpdateSystemFontsL()
    EXPORT_C TInt CEikonEnv::ResourceFileVersionNumber() const
    EXPORT_C void CEikonEnv::ControlStackReadyL()
