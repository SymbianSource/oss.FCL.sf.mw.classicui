// All the patchable variables in the BAFL DLLs need to be in a separate file.
// Care should be taken not to define the exported data in the same source file 
// in which they are referred, lest the compiler inline's it. If inlined, the 
// data cannot be patched. Hence, the definition of data must be put in a 
// separate source file and they must be declared in other source files by 
// #including "patchdata.h".
