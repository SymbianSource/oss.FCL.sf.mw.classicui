    <description>1. iDeregistered flag (and all related methods) has been renamed to iRegistered to make it less confusing.
2. IsRegistered method now checks also iRegistered flag value (in addition to check if control is an array). This method now looks as follows:
return (IsValidIndex(idx) &amp;&amp; iRegistered[idx]-&gt;Registered());
3. While re-registering a control which is allready in registered controls array we reset iRegistered flag back to ETrue</description>
